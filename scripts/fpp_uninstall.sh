# Keep this unconditional for the same reason as fpp_install.sh: versions[]
# spans FPP releases both before and after hot-load/unload support existed,
# on a single branch/sha, so uninstall must fall back to a full restart for
# the older ones in that range regardless of whether this specific FPP host
# could have hot-unloaded it.
