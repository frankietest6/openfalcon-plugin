# ShowPilot plugin install script
#
# Runs after FPP clones the repo on initial install, AND optionally when the
# user clicks "Run Install Script" or updates the plugin via FPP's plugin
# manager. Does NOT reliably run on every Update click — different FPP
# versions handle this differently.
#
# Strategy: keep this minimal and let FPP's normal restart flow handle the
# actual listener swap. We set restartFlag=1 to surface FPP's "Restart
# Required" banner; user clicks it; fppd cycles; postStop kills the listener;
# postStart spawns a fresh one with the new code. Same pattern Remote Falcon
# uses — proven to work reliably across FPP versions.
